<h2 class="p4">Foreword</h2>


<p class="pn p2">It is a significant fact that nearly all Ford cars are driven by
laymen&mdash;by owners, who in the great majority of cases have
little or no practical experience with things mechanical.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the Ford car and the ease with which it
is operated renders an intimate knowledge of mechanical technicalities
unnecessary for its operation.</p>

<p>And the further fact that there are more than twenty thousand
Ford service stations distributed throughout the civilized world&mdash;where
adjustments and repairs may be had with no annoying
delay&mdash;gives to Ford owners a singular freedom from mechanical
annoyances which beset owners of cars having limited service
facilities and distribution.</p>

<p>But while it is not imperative, it is, however, altogether desirable
that every Ford owner should thoroughly understand his
car. With such knowledge at his command he is always master
of the situation&mdash;he will maintain his car more economically&mdash;prolong
its usefulness&mdash;and he will also derive more pleasure
from it, for it is a truism that the more one knows about a thing
the more one enjoys it.</p>

<p>The mastery of a thorough knowledge of Ford construction is
by no means a difficult or time-consuming task. The Ford is the
simplest car made. It is easy to understand, and is not difficult
to keep in proper adjustment and repair.</p>

<p>That the Ford construction may be thoroughly understood&mdash;and
that there may be an authoritative guide for the making of
Ford adjustments&mdash;this book is published.</p>


<p class="pn p1 center large"><b>Important</b></p>

<p class=" pn p2"><i>It is most important that owners of Ford cars shall insist
upon getting the genuine Ford-made materials, or "Parts,"
when having repairs or replacements made. This will be
assured when the car is taken to the authorized Ford
agent. Imitation, or "bogus" or counterfeit parts of
inferior quality are being made and sold as "Ford Parts."
Avoid their use by dealing with the authorised Ford
agent.</i></p>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Before trying to start the car, fill the radiator (by removing cap at top) with clean
fresh water. If perfectly clean water cannot be obtained it is advisable to strain
it through muslin or other similar material to prevent foreign matter from getting
in and obstructing the small tubes of the radiator. The system will hold approximately
three gallons. It is important that the car should not be run under its
own power unless the water circulating system has been filled. Pour in the water
until you are sure that both radiator and cylinder water jackets are full. The
water will run out of the overflow pipe onto the ground when the entire water
system has been properly filled. During the first few days that a new car is
being driven it is a good plan to examine the radiator frequently and see that it
is kept properly filled. The water supply should be replenished as often as may
be found necessary. Soft rain water, when it is to be had in a clean state, is
superior to hard water, which may contain alkalies and other salts which tend to
deposit sediment and clog the radiator. (See chapter on Cooling System.)</p>

<table id="t002" summary="t002">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>What about Gasoline?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 2</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The ten-gallon gasoline tank should be filled&mdash;nearly full&mdash;and the supply should
never be allowed to get low. When filling the tank be sure that there are no
naked flames within several feet, as the vapor is extremely volatile and travels
rapidly. Always be careful about lighting matches near where gasoline has been
spilled, as the air within a radius of several feet is permeated with the highly
explosive vapor. The small vent hole in the gasoline tank cap should not be
allowed to get plugged up, as this would prevent proper flow of the gasoline to
the carburetor. The gasoline tank may be drained by opening the pet cock in
the sediment bulb at the bottom.</p>

<table id="t003" summary="t003">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>How about the Oiling System?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 3</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Upon receipt of the car see that a supply of medium light, high-grade gas engine
oil is poured into the crank case through the breather pipe at the front of the
engine (a metal cap covers it). Down under the car in the flywheel casing (the
reservoir which holds this oil) you will find two pet cocks. Pour oil in slowly
until it runs out of the upper cock. Leave the cock open until it stops running&mdash;then
close it. After the engine has become thoroughly limbered up, the best
results will be obtained by carrying the oil at a level midway between the two
cocks&mdash;but under no circumstances should it be allowed to get below the lower
cock. All other parts of the car are properly oiled when it leaves the factory.
However, it will be well to see that all grease cups are filled and that oil is supplied
to necessary parts. (See Cut No. 18, also chapter on Lubrication.)</p>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>How are Spark and Throttle Levers used?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 4</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Under the steering wheel are two small levers. The right-hand (throttle) lever
controls the amount of mixture (gasoline and air) which goes into the engine.
When the engine is in operation, the farther this lever is moved downward toward
the driver (referred to as "opening the throttle") the faster the engine runs and
the greater the power furnished. The left-hand lever controls the spark, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>explodes the gas in the cylinders of the engine. The advancing of this lever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
"advances the spark," and it should be moved down notch by notch until the
motor seems to reach its maximum speed. If the lever is advanced beyond this
point a dull knock will be noticed in the engine. (See chapter on Ignition.)</p>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>Where should these levers be when starting the Engine?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer&nbsp;No.&nbsp;5</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn b1 p1">The spark lever should usually be put in about the third or fourth notch of the
quadrant (the notched half-circle on which the levers operate). The throttle
should usually be opened about five or six notches. A little experience will soon
teach you where these levers should be placed for proper starting. Care should be
taken not to advance the spark lever too far, as the engine may "back kick."</p>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>What else is necessary before starting the Engine?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 6</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">First, see that the hand lever, which comes up through the floor of the car at the
left of the driver, is pulled back as far as it will go. The lever in this position
holds the clutch in neutral and engages the hub brake, thus preventing the car
moving forward when the engine is started. Second, after inserting the switch
key in the switch on the coil box, throw the switch lever as far to the left as it will
go&mdash;to the point marked "magneto." This switch connects the magneto with
the engine. The engine can't be started until it is on&mdash;and the throwing off of this
switch stops the engine.</p>

<table id="t007" summary="t007">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>How is the Engine started?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 7</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1">If the car is not equipped with a starter the engine is started by the lifting of the
starting crank at the front of the car. Take hold of the handle and push firmly
toward the car till you feel the crank ratchet engage, then lift upward with a
quick swing. With a little experience this operation wall become an easy matter.
Don't, as a usual thing, crank downward against the compression&mdash;for then an
early explosion may drive the handle vigorously backward. This does not mean
however, that it is not advisable, when the car is hard to start, to occasionally
"spin" the engine by the use of the starting handle&mdash;but be sure the spark lever
is retarded when spinning or cranking the engine against compression, otherwise
a sudden backfire may injure the arm of the operator. When the engine is cool
it is advisable to prime the carburetor by pulling on the small wire at the lower
left corner of the radiator while giving the engine two or three quarter turns with
the starting handle.</p>

<p class="b1">If the car is equipped with a starter the spark and throttle levers should be placed
in the same position on the quadrant as when cranking by hand, and the ignition
switch turned on. Current from either battery or magneto may be used for
ignition. However, we recommend that the magneto be used at all times.
The magneto was designed to furnish ignition for the Model T engine and better
results will be obtained by operating in this way. Special attention must be
paid to the position of the spark lever as a too advanced spark will cause serious
backfiring which in turn will bend or break the shaft in the starter. The starting
motor is operated by a push button, conveniently located in the floor of the car
at the driver's feet. With the spark and throttle levers in the proper position,
and the ignition switch turned on, press on the push button with the foot. This
closes the circuit between the battery and starting motor, causing the pinion
of the Bendix drive shaft to engage with the teeth on the flywheel, thus turning
over the crankshaft. When the engine is cold it may be necessary to prime it
by pulling out the carburetor priming rod, which is located on the instrument
board. In order to avoid flooding the engine with an over rich mixture of gas, the
priming rod should only be held out for a few seconds at a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<table id="t008" summary="t008">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>How is the Engine best started in cold weather?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 8</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1">As gasoline does not vaporize readily in cold weather it is naturally more difficult
to start the motor under such conditions. The usual method of starting the engine
when cold is to turn the carburetor dash adjustment one-quarter turn to the left
in order to allow a richer mixture of gasoline to be drawn into the cylinders; then
hold out the priming rod, while you turn crank from six to eight one-quarter
turns in quick succession, or turn the motor over a few times with the starter.
Another method of starting a troublesome cold engine is as follows: Before
you throw on the magneto switch, (1) close throttle lever; (2) hold out priming
rod while you give crank several quick turns, or turn the motor over a few times
with the starter, then let go of priming rod (being careful that it goes back
all the way); (3) place spark lever in about third notch and advance throttle
lever several notches; (4) throw on switch (being sure to get it on side marked
"Magneto"); (5) give crank one or two turns, or close the starting switch, and the
motor should start. After starting the motor it is advisable to advance the spark
eight or ten notches on the quadrant and let the motor run until thoroughly
heated up. If you start out with a cold motor you will not have much power
and are liable to "stall." The advantage of turning on the switch last, or after
priming, is that when you throw on the switch and start the motor, you have
plenty of gas in the cylinders, to keep the motor running, thereby eliminating the
trouble of the motor starting and stopping. After motor is warmed up turn
carburetor adjustment back one-quarter turn.</p>

<p class="b1">To facilitate starting many drivers make a practice of stopping their engine by
pulling out on the priming rod, which has the effect of shutting off the air suction
and filling the cylinders full of a very rich gasoline vapor. This should not be
done unless the car is going to stand over night or long enough to cool off. If the
motor is stopped in this way and then started when hot, starting is apt to be difficult
on account of the surplus gasoline in the carburetor.</p>

<table id="t009" summary="t009">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>What function does the Hand Lever perform?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 9</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Its chief purpose is to hold the clutch in neutral position. If it were not for this
lever the driver would have to stop the engine whenever he left the driver's seat.
He would also be unable to crank the engine without the car starting forward
with the first explosion. When pulled back as far as it will go, the hand lever
acts as an emergency brake on the rear wheels, by expanding the brake shoes in
the rear wheel drums. Therefore the hand lever should be back as far as it will
go when cranking the engine or when the car is at rest. It should be only in a
vertical position, and not far enough backward to act as a brake on the rear wheels,
when the car is to be reversed. When the car is operating in high or low speed
the hand lever should be all the way forward.</p>

 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The first one toward the left operates the clutch. When pressed forward the
clutch pedal engages the low speed. When half-way forward the clutch is in
neutral (i. e., disconnected from the driving mechanism of the rear wheels), and
the releasing of this pedal engages the high-speed clutch. The center pedal
operates the reverse. The right-hand pedal operates the transmission brake.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Slightly accelerate the engine by opening the throttle, press the clutch pedal
half way forward, thereby holding the clutch in a neutral position while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
throwing the hand lever forward; then press the pedal forward into slow speed
and when under sufficient headway (20 to 30 feet), allow the pedal to drop
back slowly into high speed, at the same time partially closing the throttle, which
will allow the engine to pick up its load easily. With a little practice, the
change of speeds will be easily accomplished, and without any appreciable
effect on the smooth running of the machine.</p>

<table id="t012" summary="t012">

  <td class="tdlh"><i>How is the Car stopped?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 12</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Partially close the throttle; release the high speed by pressing the clutch pedal
forward into neutral; apply the foot brake slowly but firmly until the car comes
to a dead stop. Do not remove foot from the clutch pedal without first pulling
the hand lever back to neutral position, or the engine will stall. To stop the
motor, open the throttle a trifle to accelerate the motor and then throw off the
switch. The engine will then stop with the cylinders full of explosive gas, which
will naturally facilitate starting.</p>

<p class="b1">Endeavor to so familiarize yourself with the operation of the car that to disengage
the clutch and apply the brake becomes practically automatic&mdash;the natural thing
to do in case of emergency.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">It must be brought to a dead stop. With the engine running, disengage the clutch
with the hand lever and press the reverse pedal forward with the left foot, the
right foot being free to use on the brake pedal if needed. Do not bring the hand
lever back too far or you will set the brakes on rear wheels. Experienced drivers
ordinarily reverse the car by simply holding the clutch pedal in neutral with the
left foot, and operating the reverse pedal with the right.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">By the left-hand lever under the steering wheel. Good operators drive with
the spark lever advanced just as far as the engine will permit. However, advancing
the spark too far will cause a dull knock in the motor, due to the fact that
the explosion occurs too early. The spark should only be retarded when the
engine slows down on a heavy road or steep grade, but care should be exercised
not to retard the spark too far as this will result in late ignition, which causes
loss of power and overheating of the motor and may also result in warped,
burned or cracked valves. Learn to operate the spark as the occasion demands.
The greatest economy in gasoline consumption is obtained by driving with the
spark advanced sufficiently to obtain the maximum speed.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The different speeds required to meet road conditions are obtained by opening
or closing the throttle. Practically all the running speeds needed for ordinary
travel are obtained on high gear, and it is seldom necessary to use the low gear
except to give the car momentum in starting. The speed of the car may be temporarily
slackened in driving through crowded traffic, turning corners, etc., by
"slipping the clutch," i. e., pressing the clutch pedal forward into neutral.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The Ford is the simplest of all cars. Most of the ordinary adjustments an owner
will soon learn to make for himself. But we must strongly recommend that when
it becomes necessary to employ the services of a mechanic, the car be taken to a
Ford mechanic&mdash;one of our own representatives who thoroughly understands
the car&mdash;and who will have no motive for running up useless repair bills. The
entire Ford organization is interested in keeping every individual Ford car in
constant operation, at the lowest possible cost. We have known of much damage
done to many cars by unskilled repair men.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Remember that a new machine requires more careful attention during the first
few days it is being driven than after the parts have become thoroughly "worked
in." The car which is driven slowly and carefully when new usually gives the
most satisfactory service in the end. Never start out with your car until you are
sure that is has plenty of oil and water. Frequently inspect the running gear.
See that no unnecessary play exists in either front or rear wheels, and that all
bolts and nuts are tight. Make a practice of taking care of every repair or
adjustment as soon as its necessity is discovered. This attention requires but
little time and may avoid delay or possible accident on the road. We aim to
deliver the car in proper mechanical adjustment. Afterwards it is plainly the
duty of the driver to keep it in that condition.</p>

  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 18</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Gasoline when mixed with air and compressed is highly explosive. An explosion
is a violent expansion caused by instantaneous combustion of confined gases.
In the gasoline engine the mixture is drawn into a cylinder, where it is compressed
by an advancing piston and then exploded by an electric spark, which sends the
piston downward, and through the connecting rod imparts a rotary motion to the
crankshaft. (See Cut No. 2.)</p>

<table id="t019" summary="t019">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>What are the functions of the Pistons?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 19</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1 pn b1">On the downward stroke the suction of the piston draws the fresh gas from the
carburetor, through the inlet pipe and valve, into the cylinder. The upward
movement of the piston compresses the gas into a very small space, between the
top of the piston and the depression in the cylinder head, known as the "combustion
chamber." (The compressed gases exert a pressure of approximately 60
pounds per square inch.) At this point the electric spark, generated by the
magneto, explodes the gases&mdash;driving the piston downward&mdash;thus producing
the power which turns the crank shaft. On the next stroke upward the piston
drives the exploded gas out through the exhaust valve and pipe to the muffler.
(See Cut No. 3.)</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">It is a steel rod, connecting piston and crank shaft. Should the babbitt bearing
become worn, or burned out through lack of oil, a knocking in the engine will
result in which case the entire connecting rod should be replaced. To make this
replacement, (1) drain oil from crank case; (2) take off cylinder head; (3) remove

 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">One intake and one exhaust valve are located in each cylinder. The former admits
the fresh gas drawn from the carburetor through the inlet pipe&mdash;the latter
permits the exploded gas to be driven out through the exhaust pipe. The valves
are alternately opened and closed (see Cut No. 3) by the cams on the cam shaft
striking against push rods which in turn lift the valves from their seats.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">In timing the engine the points of opening and closing of the valves are, of course,
what should be considered. As the valves are properly timed at the factory
when the engine is built the necessity for retiming would occur only when such
parts as the cam shaft, time gears or valves were removed in overhauling the
engine.</p>

cam points in a direction opposite to the zero mark (see Cut No. 3). The time
gears must also mesh so that the tooth marked zero (0) on the small time gear will
come between the two teeth on the large gear at the zero point. The time gears
now being properly set, the exhaust valve on No. 1 cylinder is open and the intake
valve closed, the other valves being in the position indicated in Cut No. 3.
The opening and closing of the valves being as follows: The exhaust valve opens
when the piston reaches 5/16″ of bottom center, the distance from the top of the
piston head to the top of cylinder casting measuring 3⅜″. The exhaust valve
will close on top centre, the piston being 5/16″ above the cylinder casting. The

on the valve seats. These carbon deposits by preventing proper closing of the
valves, permit the gases under compression to escape, resulting in loss of power
and uneven running of the motor. If, when turning the engine over slowly, there is
a lack of resistance in one or more cylinders, it is probable that the valves need
re-grinding. As the "life" of the engine depends largely upon the proper seating
of the valves, it is necessary that they be ground occasionally.</p>

and rotate it back and forth (about
a quarter turn) a few times, with a
Ford grinding tool. Then lift slightly
from the seat, change the position
and continue the rotation, and keep
on repeating this operation until the

The valve should not be turned
through a complete revolution, as this
is apt to cause scratches running

valve and seat. When the grinding
is completed the valve should be removed
from the cylinder, thoroughly
washed with kerosene, and the valve
seat wiped out thoroughly. Extreme
care should be taken that no abrasive
substance gets into the cylinders or
valve guides. This can be avoided
if the grinding paste is applied sparingly to the bevel face of the valve.
If the valve seat is worn badly or seamed, it is best to have it reseated with a valve
seating tool. This operation requires considerable skill, and perhaps had better be
done by an expert mechanic. Care should be exercised against making too deep a
cut, necessitating the retiming of the valve.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">When the valves or push rods become worn, so as to leave too much play between
them, thus reducing the lift of the valves and diminishing the power of the motor,
it is best to replace the push rods with new ones. The clearance between the push
rods and the valve stem should never be greater than 1/32″ nor less than 1/64″. If the
clearance is greater, the valve will open late and close early, resulting in uneven
running of the motor. If the clearance is less than 1/64″ there is danger of the valve
remaining partially open all the time. If replacing the push rod does not give the
proper clearance, the valve should also be replaced. We do not recommend drawing
out the valve stem, as the operation requires experience and the price of the
new part does not warrant the time and expense necessary to properly do the work.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">When the valves fail to seat themselves properly, there is a possibility that the
springs may be weak or broken. A weak inlet spring would probably not affect
the running of the engine, but weakness in the exhaust valve spring causes a very
uneven action, which is difficult to locate. The symptoms area lag in the engine due
to the exhaust valve not closing instantaneously, and as a result a certain percentage
of the charge under compression escapes, greatly diminishing the force of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
explosion. Weakness in a valve spring can usually be detected by the following
method: Remove the plate which encloses them at the side of the cylinder and
insert a screw driver between the coils of the spring while the engine is running.
If the extra tension thus produced causes the engine to pick up speed, the spring is
obviously weak and should be replaced with a new one.</p>

grades, particularly when the engine is heated. It is also indicated by a sharp
rap immediately on advancing the throttle. (2) Too advanced spark will be
indicated by a dull knock in the motor. (3) The connecting rod knock sounds like
the distant tapping of steel with a small hammer, and is readily distinguished when
the car is allowed to run idly down grade&mdash;or upon speeding the car to twenty-five
miles an hour, then suddenly closing the throttle, the tapping will be very distinct.
(4) The crank shaft main bearing knock can be distinguished, when the car is
going uphill, as a dull thud. (5) The loose piston knock is heard only upon suddenly
opening the throttle, when the sound produced might be likened to a rattle. The
remedies for these knocks are treated under their proper division.</p>

the plug should be taken apart by securing the large hexagon steel shell in a vise
and loosening the pack nut which holds the porcelain in place. The carbon
deposits can then be easily removed from the porcelain and shell with a small
knife. Care should be exercised not to scrape off the glazed surface of the porcelain,
otherwise it will be apt to carbonize quickly. The porcelain and other parts should
finally be washed in gasoline and wiped dry with a cloth.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Connecting rod bearings may be adjusted, without taking out the engine, by the
following method: (1) drain off the oil; (2) remove plate on bottom of crank case&mdash;exposing
connecting rods; (3) take off first connecting rod cap, and draw-file the
ends&mdash;a very little at a time; (4) replace cap, being careful to see that file marks
correspond, and tighten bolts until it fits shaft snugly; (5) test tightness of bearing
by turning engine over by the starting handle. Experienced mechanics usually
determine when the bearing is properly fitted by lightly tapping each side of the
cap with a hammer; (6) then loosen the bearing and proceed to fit the other
bearings in the same manner; (7) after each bearing has been properly fitted and
tested&mdash;then tighten the cap bolts and the work is finished.</p>

<p>Remember, there is a possibility of getting the bearings too tight, and under such
conditions the babbitt is apt to cut out quickly, unless precaution is taken to run
the motor slowly at the start. It is a good plan after adjusting the bearings to
jack up the rear wheels and let the motor run slowly for about two hours (keeping
it well supplied with water and oil) before taking it out on the road. Whenever
possible these bearings should be fitted by an expert Ford mechanic.</p>

<p class="b1">Worn connecting rods may be returned, prepaid, to the nearest dealer or branch
house for exchange at a price of $1.00 each to cover the cost of rebabbitting. It is
not advisable for any owner or repair shop to attempt the rebabbitting of connecting
rods or main bearings, for without a special jig in which to form the bearings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
satisfactory results will not be obtained. The constant tapping of a loose connecting

<p class="pn p1">Should the stationary bearings in which the crank shaft revolves become worn
(evidenced by a pounding in the motor) and need replacing or adjusting, proceed
as follows:</p>

<p class="pn">(1) After the engine has been taken out of the car, remove crank case, transmission
cover, cylinder head, pistons, connecting rods, transmission and magneto
coils. Take off the three babbitted caps and clean the bearing surfaces with gasoline.
Apply Prussian blue or red lead to the crank shaft bearing surfaces, which will
enable you, in fitting the caps, to determine whether a perfect bearing surface is
obtained.</p>

<p class="pn">(2) Place the rear cap in position and tighten it up as much as possible without
stripping the bolt threads. When the bearing has been properly fitted, the crank
shaft can be turned with one hand. If the crank shaft cannot be turned with one
hand, the contact between the bearing surfaces is evidently too close, and the cap
requires shimming up, one or two brass liners usually being sufficient. In case
the crank shaft moves too easily with one hand, the shims should be removed and
the steel surface of the cap filed off, permitting it to set closer.</p>

<p class="pn">(3) After removing the cap, observe whether the blue or red "spottings" indicate a
full bearing the length of the cap. If "spottings" do not show a true bearing, the
babbitt should be scraped and the cap refitted until the proper results are obtained.</p>

<p class="pn">(4) Lay the rear cap aside and proceed to adjust the center bearing in the same
manner. Repeat the operation with the front bearing, with the other two bearings
laid aside.</p>

<p class="pn p1">(5) When the proper adjustment of each bearing has been obtained, clean the
babbitt surface carefully and place a little lubricating oil on the bearings, also on
the crank shaft; then draw the caps up as closely as possible&mdash;the necessary shims,
of course, being in place. Do not be afraid of getting the cap bolts too tight, as
the shim under the cap and the oil between the bearing surfaces will prevent the
metal being drawn into too close contact. If oil is not put on the bearing surfaces,
the babbitt is apt to cut out when the motor is started up before the oil in the crank
case can get into the bearing. In replacing the crank case and transmission cover
on the motor, it is advisable to use a new set of gaskets to prevent oil leaks.</p>

which are attached scientifically worked out fins, which assist in the rapid
radiation of the heat. The fan, just back of the radiator, sucks the air around the
tubing&mdash;around which the air is also driven by the forward movement of the car.
The belt should be inspected frequently and tightened when necessary&mdash;not too

shows how the gasoline enters the carburetor, is vaporized by a current of air and
passes through the inlet pipe to the engine in the form of an explosive mixture.
The gasoline, entering the bowl of the carburetor, gradually raises the float to a
point where the inlet needle is forced upwards into its seat, thus cutting off the
flow of gasoline. As the gasoline in the bowl recedes, the float lowers, allowing
the needle to drop from its seat and the flow of gasoline is resumed. It is plain to
see that a constant level of gasoline is maintained in the carburetor by the automatic
action of float and needle. The quantity of gasoline entering into the mixture
is governed by the needle valve (see Answer No. 45). The volume of gas mixture
entering the intake pipe is controlled by opening and closing the throttle, according
to the speed desired by the driver.</p>

and is likewise wasteful of the fuel. It will often choke the engine and cause misfiring
at slow speeds, although at high speeds the machine will run perfectly. The
mixture should be kept as lean as possible without the sacrifice of any of the power
of the motor. A lean mixture will often result in backfiring through the carburetor,
for the reason that the gas burns slowly in the cylinder, and is still burning when
the inlet valve opens again, which causes the gas in the intake to ignite. A rich
mixture is shown by heavy, black exhaust smoke with a disagreeable smell.
Proper mixture will cause very little smoke or odor.</p>

the throttle lever to about the sixth notch, with the spark retarded to about the
fourth notch. The flow of gasoline should now be cut off by screwing the needle

the gasoline feed by opening the needle valve until the motor picks up and reaches
its highest speed and no trace of black smoke comes from the exhaust. Whenever

which needle passes should first be loosened, as otherwise it is impossible to tell
when the needle is turned down in its seat too far. Turning the needle down too
tightly will result in its becoming grooved and the seat enlarged. When these parts
are damaged it is difficult to maintain proper adjustment of the carburetor. Having
determined the point where the motor runs at its maximum speed, the needle
valve lock nut should be tightened to prevent the adjustment being disturbed. For
average running, a lean mixture will give better results than a rich one.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The presence of water in the carburetor or gasoline tank, even in small amounts,
will prevent easy starting and the motor will misfire and stop. As water is heavier
than gasoline it settles to the bottom of the tank and into the sediment bulb along
with other foreign matter. As it is difficult nowadays to get gasoline absolutely
free from impurities, especially water, it is advisable to frequently drain the sediment
bulb under the gasoline tank. During cold weather the water which accumulates
in the sediment bulb is likely to freeze and prevent the flow of gasoline
through the pipe leading to the carburetor. Should anything of this kind happen
it is possible to open the gasoline line by wrapping a cloth around the sediment
bulb and keeping it saturated with hot water for a short time. Then the water
should be drained off. In event the water gets down into the carburetor and
freezes, the same treatment may be applied.</p>

This is accounted for by the fact that at high speeds the increased suction will
draw the particles of dust, etc., into the nozzle. By opening the valve needle half a
turn and giving the throttle lever two or three quick pulls the dirt or sediment
will often be drawn through, when the needle may be turned back to its original
place. If this does not accomplish the purpose, the carburetor should be drained.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">No. The carburetor does not ordinarily require priming when the motor is warm,
and starting with the rod pulled out is apt to "flood" the engine with an over-rich
mixture of gas, which does not readily explode. This naturally causes difficulty
in starting. If you should accidentally flood the engine, turn the carburetor
adjusting needle down (to the right) until it seats; then turn the engine over a few
times in order to exhaust the rich gas. As soon as the motor starts, turn back
the needle (to the left) and readjust the carburetor.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Yes. When the vibrators are not properly adjusted more current is required to
make and break the contact between the points, and, as a result, at cranking
speeds you would not get a spark between the spark plug points. Do not allow
the contact points to become "ragged," otherwise they are apt to stick and cause
unnecessary difficulty in starting, and when running they are apt to produce an
occasional "miss" in the engine.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The commutator (or timer) determines the instant at which the spark plugs must
fire. It effects the "make and break" in the primary circuit. The grounded wire
in the magneto allows the current to flow through the metal parts to the metal
roller in the commutator. Therefore, when the commutator roller in revolving
touches the four commutator contact points, to each of which is attached a wire
connected with a coil unit, an electrical circuit is passed through the entire system
of primary wires. This circuit is only momentary, however, as the roller passes
over the contact point very rapidly and sets up the circuit in each unit as the roller
touches the contact point connected with that unit. The commutator should be
kept clean and well oiled at all times.</p>

The high voltage current flows out of the secondary coils in the coil box and on
reaching the contact points in each spark plug it is forced to jump a 1/32″ gap,
thereby forming a spark which ignites the gasoline charge in the cylinders.</p>

<p class="b1">The spark plugs should be kept clean (i. e., free from carbon) and should be replaced
if they persist in not working properly. There is nothing to be gained by
experimenting with different makes of plugs. The make of plugs with which Ford
engines are equipped when they leave the factory are best adapted to the requirements
of our motor, notwithstanding the opinion of various garage men to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

4. Relieve No. 4 and hold down No. 2 and No. 3 and also No. 1; if No. 4 cylinder
explodes evenly it is evident the misfiring is in No. 1. In this manner all of the

<p class="pn p1 b1">The trouble is probably due to an improperly seated valve, worn commutator, or
short circuit in the commutator wiring. Weakness in the valves may be easily
determined by lifting the starting crank slowly the length of the stroke of each
cylinder in turn, a strong or weak compression in any particular valve being easily
detected. It sometimes happens that the cylinder head gasket (packing) becomes
leaky&mdash;permitting the gas under compression to escape, a condition that can be
detected by running a little lubricating oil around the edge of the gasket and noticing
whether bubbles appear or not.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Yes. If misfiring occurs when running at high speed, inspect the commutator.
The surface of the circle around which roller (see Cut No. 9) travels should be
clean and smooth, so that the roller makes a perfect contact at all points. If the
roller fails to make a good contact on any one of the four contact points, its corresponding
cylinder will not fire. Clean these surfaces, if dirty. In case the fibre, contact
points and roller of the commutator are badly worn the most satisfactory
remedy is to replace them with new parts. The spring should be strong enough to
make a firm contact between the roller points if they are worn or dirty.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">It is a well-known fact that in cold weather even the best grades of lubricating oil
are apt to congeal to some extent. If this occurs in the commutator it is very apt
to prevent the roller from making perfect contact with the contact points imbedded
in the fibre. This, of course, makes difficult starting as the roller arm spring is not
stiff enough to brush away the film of oil which naturally forms over the contact
points. To overcome this, as well as any liability of the contact points to rust, we
recommend a mixture of 25% kerosene with commutator lubricating oil, which will
thin it sufficiently to prevent congealing, or freezing, as it is commonly called. You
have probably noticed in starting your car in cold weather that perhaps only one
or two cylinders will fire for the first minute or so, which indicates that the timer
is in the condition described above and as a consequence a perfect contact is not
being made on each of the four terminals.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The Ford magneto is made of permanent magnets and there is very little likelihood
of their ever losing their strength, unless acted upon by some outside force. For
instance, the attachment of a storage battery to the magneto terminal will
demagnetize the magnets. If anything like this happens, it is not advisable to try
to recharge them, but rather install a complete set of new magnets. The new
magnets will be sent from the nearest agent or branch house, and will be placed on
a board in identically the same manner as they should be when installed on the
flywheel. Great care should be taken in assembling the magnets and lining up the
magneto so that the faces of the magnets are separated from the surface of the coil
spool just 1/32 of an inch. To take out the old magnets, simply remove the cap screw
and bronze screw which holds each in place. The magneto is often blamed when
the trouble is a weak current caused by waste or other foreign matter accumulating
under the contact spring, which is held in place by the binding post on top of the
crank case cover. Remove the three screws which hold the binding post in place,
remove binding post and spring and replace after foreign substance has been

<p class="pn p1 b1">The slow speed band may be tightened by loosening the lock nut at the right side
of the transmission cover, and turning the adjusting screw (see Cut No. 12) to the
right. To tighten the brake and reverse bands remove the transmission cover
door and turn the adjusting nuts on the shafts to the right. See that the bands do
not drag on the drums when disengaged, as they exert a brake effect, and tend to
overheat the motor. However, the foot brake should be adjusted so that a sudden
pressure will stop the car immediately, or slide the rear wheels in case of emergency.
The bands, when worn to such an extent that they will not take hold properly,
should be relined, so that they will engage smoothly without causing a jerky movement
of the car. The lining is inexpensive and may be had at any Ford service
station at small cost.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Remove the starting motor (see Answer No. 128). Take off the door on top of
transmission cover. Turn the reverse adjustment nut and the brake adjustment
nut to the extreme end of the pedal shafts, then remove the slow speed adjusting
screw. Remove the bolts holding the transmission cover to crank case and lift off
the cover assembly. Slip the band nearest the flywheel over the first of the triple
gears, then turn the band around so that the opening is downward. The band
can now be removed by lifting upward. The operation is more easily accomplished
if the three sets of triple gears are so placed that one set is about ten degrees to the
right of center at top. Each band is removed by the same operation. It is necessary
to shove each band forward on to the triple gears as at this point only is there
sufficient clearance in the crank case to allow the ears of the transmission bands
to be turned downward. By reversing this operation the bands may be installed.
After being placed in their upright position on the drums pass a cord around the
ears of the three bands, holding them in the center so that when putting the
transmission cover in place no trouble will be experienced in getting the pedal
shafts to rest in the notches in the band ears. The clutch release ring must be
placed in the rear groove of the clutch shift. With the cover in place remove
the cord which held the bands in place while the cover was being installed.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Cut No. 13 shows the transmission parts in their relative assembling positions and
grouped in their different operations of assembling.</p>

<p class="b1">The first operation is the assembling of group No. 2, which is as follows: Place
the brake drum on table with the hub in a vertical position, place the slow speed
plate over the hub with gear uppermost. Then place reverse plate over the slow
speed plate so that the reverse gear surrounds the slow speed gear. Fit the two
keys in the hub just above the slow speed gear. Put the driven gear in position
with the teeth downward so that they will come next to the slow speed gear. Take
the three triple gears and mesh them with the driven gear according to the punch
marks on the teeth, the reverse gear or smallest of the triple gear assembly being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a><br /><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>downward. After making sure that the triple gears are properly meshed tie them
in place by passing a cord around the outside of the three gears. Take the flywheel
and place it on the table with the face downward and the transmission
shaft in a vertical position; then invert the group which you have assembled over
the transmission shaft, setting it in position so that the triple gear pins on the
flywheel will pass through the triple gears. This will bring the brake drum on
top in a position to hold the clutch plates, etc. The next step is to fit the clutch
drum key in the transmission shaft. Press the clutch disc drum over the shaft
and put the set screw in place to hold the drum. Put a large disc over the clutch
drum, then a small disc, alternating with large and small discs until the entire
set of discs are in position, ending up with a large disc on top.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="p1 b1">If a small disc is on top it is liable to fall over the clutch drum in changing the speed
from high to low and as a result you would be unable to change the speed back into
high. Next put the clutch push ring over the clutch drum, and on top of the discs
with the three pins projecting upward (see Group No. 4, Cut No. 13). You will
note the remaining parts are placed as they will be assembled. Next bolt the driving
plate in position so that the adjusting screws of the clutch fingers will bear
against the clutch push ring pins. Before proceeding further it would be a good
plan to test the transmission by moving the plates with the hands. If the transmission
is properly assembled they will revolve freely. The clutch parts may
be assembled on the driving plate hub as follows: Slip the clutch shift over the
hub so that the small end rests on the ends of the clutch fingers. Next put on the
clutch spring, placing the clutch support inside so that the flange will rest on the
upper coil of the spring and press into place, inserting the pin in the driving
plate hub through the holes in the side of the spring support. Then turn the
clutch spring support until the pin fits into the lugs on the bottom of the support.
The easiest method of compressing the spring sufficiently to insert the pin is
to loosen the tension of the clutch finger by means of the adjusting screws.
When tightening up the clutch again the spring should be compressed to
within a space of two or two and one-sixteenth inches to insure against the clutch
slipping. Care should be exercised to see that the screws in the fingers are adjusted
so the spring is compressed evenly all around.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The wheels should be jacked up periodically and tested, not only for smoothness
of running, but for side play as well. If in spinning a front wheel a sharp
click occurs now and then and the wheel is momentarily checked, it is probable
that there is a chipped or split ball in the bearing which should be removed,
otherwise it may necessitate the removal of the entire bearing. A wheel in perfect
adjustment should, after spinning, come to rest with the tire valve directly below
the hub. Undue wear of the hub bearings is usually caused by lack of lubrication
and excessive friction, due to the adjusting cone being screwed up too
tight. It is a good plan to clean the bearings frequently and keep the hub well
filled with grease.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Front wheels: Take off hub cap, remove cotter pin and unscrew castle nut and
spindle washer. The adjustable bearing cone can then be taken out and the
wheel removed. Care should be taken to see that the cones and lock nuts are
replaced on the same spindle from which they were removed, otherwise there is
a liability of stripping the threads which are left on the left spindle and right on the
opposite as you stand facing the car. Rear wheels: They should not be removed
unless absolutely necessary&mdash;in which case proceed as above, then with a wheel
puller remove the wheel from the tapered shaft to which it is locked with a key.
In replacing rear wheels be sure that nut on axle shaft is as tight as possible and
cotter pin in place. The hub caps of the rear wheels should be removed occasionally
and the lock nuts which hold the hub in place tightened up. If these nuts
are allowed to work loose, the resulting play on the hub key may eventually
twist off the axle shaft.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">It will be observed that the front wheels are "dished;" that is, the spokes are
given a slight outward flare to enable them to meet side stresses with less rigid
resistance&mdash;while the spokes of the rear wheels are straight. The front wheels
are also placed at an angle&mdash;that is to say, the distance between the tops of the
front wheels is about three inches greater than between the bottoms. This is to
give perfect steering qualities and to save wear on the tires when turning corners.
The front wheels should not, however, "toe-in" at the front&mdash;at least not more
than a quarter of an inch. Lines drawn along the outside of the wheels when the
latter are straight in a forward position should be parallel. All wheels should
always be kept in proper alignment, otherwise steering will be difficult and tire
wear greatly increased. Adjustment can be made by turning the yoke at the
left end of the spindle connecting rod, to draw the wheels into a parallel position.</p>

<p class="pn p1">First, pack the hub full of clean good quality cup grease. Take the inner cone
with its rollers and pack it with grease, filling all of the space around and between
the rollers. Then place the inner cone in the larger cup. Next, drive the dust
ring with felt washer into the inner end of the hub so that it is flush with the end
of the hub.</p>

<p class="b1">Place the wheel carrying the inner bearings with dust ring on the spindle. The
inner cone is a one-thousandth fit, or, in other words, a slip fit on the spindle.
(See Cut No. 17.) It is never necessary to force the cone onto the spindle as the
cups are forced into the hub. Pack the outer or threaded cone and rollers with
cup grease, filling all the space between the rollers, as was done with the inner cone.
The cones are made up in right-and left-hand threads to correspond to the threads
on the spindles. Care should be taken that a right-hand threaded cone is not
forced onto a left-hand threaded spindle. The right-hand thread is on the left-hand
side of the car, while the left-hand thread is on the right-hand side of the
car. Place the cone on the spindle, running it up tight enough so that the wheel
seems to bind; give the wheel a few turns to be sure that all the working parts
are in perfect contact; then back off the cone ¼ to ½ a turn which will be sufficient
to allow the wheel to revolve freely without end play. To determine if
there is end play, grasp the spokes and shake the wheel. Do not mistake
loose spindle bushings for loose bearings. Insert a cold chisel between axle and
spindle to take up any play while testing the bearings. Next, put on the spindle
washer and nut, drawing the nut to a firm bearing. Make sure that the cone
has not been forced out of adjustment. This can be determined by giving the
wheel a few turns. Insert the cotter pin which locks the nut on the spindle, fill
the hub cap with grease and screw it in place on the hub.</p>

the leaves polished with emery cloth, afterwards packing them with graphite
when reassembling. Rust can be prevented from accumulating on the springs
by painting them when necessary with a quick drying black paint. You will

<p class="pn p1">Should the steering gear become loose, that is, so that a slight movement of the
wheel does not produce immediate results, it may be tightened in the following
manner: Disconnect the two halves of the ball sockets which surround the ball
arm at the lower end of the steering post and file off the surface until they fit
snugly around the ball. If the ball is badly worn it is best to replace it with a new
one. Also tighten the ball caps at the other end of the steering gear connecting
rod in the same manner. If the bolts in the steering spindle arms appear to be
loose, the brass bushings should be replaced with new ones (see Cut No. 16).
Excessive play in the front axle may be detected by grasping one of the front
wheels by the spokes and jerking the front axle back and forth. After the car
has been in service two or three years excessive play in the steering gear may
make necessary the renewal of the little pinions, as well as the brass internal gear
just underneath the steering wheel spider.</p>

and repeat the operation two or three times. Always open oil cups by turning
to right, as this keeps tightening rather than loosening them. Occasionally
remove front wheels and supply dope to wearing surface. A drop of oil now and
then in crank-handle bearing is necessary, also on fan belt pulleys and shaft. The
axles drive shaft and universal joint are well supplied with lubricant when the
car leaves the factory, but it is well to examine and oil them frequently.</p>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">We recommend only medium light high-grade gas engine oil for use in the Model T
motor. A medium light grade of oil is preferred as it will naturally reach the bearings
with greater ease and consequently less heat will develop on account of friction.
The oil should, however, have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two
bearing surfaces will not force the oil out and allow the metal to come in actual
contact. Heavy and inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also
"gum up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light
grade of oil having a low cold test is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication
of the car. Graphite should not be used as a lubricant in the engine or the transmission
as it will have a tendency to short-circuit the magneto.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">It is advisable to clean out the crank case by draining off the dirty oil when the
new car has been driven three hundred and fifty miles; thereafter it will only be
necessary to repeat this operation about every seven hundred and fifty miles.
Remove the plug underneath the flywheel casing and drain off the oil. Replace
the plug and pour in a gallon of kerosene oil through the breather pipe. Turn
the engine over fifteen or twenty times so that the splash from the kerosene oil
will thoroughly cleanse the engine. Remove crank case plug and drain off kerosene
oil. It is of vital importance that all the kerosene be removed from the
depressions in the crank case. To do this put about a quart of lubricating oil
into the motor and turn engine over several times, then remove the crank case
plug and drain off the flushing oil; then replace plug and refill with fresh oil.

The housing should not be more than one-third full. The differential is supplied

necessary. If a fluid grease is used the level should be approximately one and

<p class="pn p1 b1">First, jack up the wheel clear of the road. The valve cap should be unscrewed,
the lock nut removed and the valve stem pushed into the tire until its bead is
flush with the rim. This done, loosen up the head of the shoe in the clinch of
the rim by working and pushing with the hands, then insert one of the tire irons
or levers under the beads. The tire iron should be pushed in just enough to get
a good hold on the under side of the bead, but not so far as to "pinch" the inner
tube between the rim and the tool. A second iron should be inserted in the same
fashion some seven or eight inches from the first, and the third tool the same distance
from the second. As a clincher tire must be pried over the clinch, three
levers will come in handy in a case of a "one-man job," and the knee of the driver
can be used to good advantage to hold down one lever while the other two are
being manipulated in working the shoe clear of the rim. After freeing a length
of the bead from the clinch, the entire outer edge of the casing may be readily
detached with the hands, and the damaged inner tube removed and "patched"
or a spare tube inserted. Always use plenty of soapstone in replacing an inner
tube.</p>

</table>

<p class="pn p1">Should the casing be cut so there is danger of the inner tube being blown through
it, a temporary repair can be made by cementing a canvas patch on the inside
of the casing. Before applying the patch the part of the casing affected should
be cleaned with gasoline and when dry, rubber cement applied to both casing and
patch. This will answer as an emergency repair&mdash;but the casing should be vulcanized
at the first opportunity.</p>

<p class="b1">To prolong the life of the tire casings, any small cuts in the tread should be filled
with patching cement and a specially prepared "plastic" sold by the tire companies.</p>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdlh"><i>How may Tire Expense be reduced?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 106</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1">Tire cost constitutes one of the most important items in the running expenses of
an automobile. To get the most service at the least expense, the tires should be
inspected frequently and all small cuts or holes properly sealed or repaired&mdash;thus
preventing dirt and water working in between the rubber tread and the fabric,
causing blisters or sand boils.</p>

<p>Tires should never be run partially deflated, as the side walls are unduly bent
and the fabric is subject to stresses which cause what is known as rim cutting.
The chances of getting a puncture will be greatly reduced by keeping your tires
properly inflated, as a hard tire exposes much less surface to the road than a soft
tire, and also deflects sharp objects that would penetrate a soft tire.</p>

<p>Running a tire flat, even for a short distance, is sure to be costly. Better run
on the rim, very slowly and carefully, rather than on a flat tire.</p>

<p>Remember that fast driving and skidding shorten the life of the tires. Avoid
locking the wheels with the brakes&mdash;no tire will stand the strain of being dragged
over the pavement in this fashion.</p>

<p>Avoid running in street car tracks, in ruts, or bumping the sides of the tire against
the curbing.</p>

<p class="b1">The wheel rims should be painted each season and kept free from rust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
When a car is idle for any appreciable length of time, it should be jacked up to
take the load off the tires. If the car is laid up for many months it is best to
remove the tires, and wrap up the outer casings and inner tubes separately, and
store them in a dark room not exposed to extreme temperatures. Remove oil
or grease from the tires with gasoline. Remember that heat, light and oil are
three natural enemies of rubber.</p>

  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 107</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">After locating the puncture, carefully clean the rubber around the leak with
benzine or gasoline. Then roughen the surface with sandpaper to give a hold for
the cement. Apply the cement to both patch and tube, allowing it to dry for
about five minutes, repeating the application twice with like intervals between
for drying. When the cement is dry and sticky press the patch against the tube
firmly and thoroughly to remove all air bubbles beneath it and insure proper
adherence to the surface&mdash;then spread some soapstone or talc powder over the
repair so as to prevent the tube sticking to the casing. Before the tube is put
back into the casing plenty of talc powder should be sprinkled into the latter.
A cement patch is not usually permanent and the tube should be vulcanized as
soon as possible. In replacing the tire on the rim be very careful not to pinch
the tube.</p>

should be used and carried at a level with the upper oil plug. The differential
is supplied with the required amount of lubricant when the truck leaves the factory
and the supply should be maintained by replenishments as required. After
running the truck about 500 miles, the oil should be drained off by removing
the lower oil plug, and the differential filled with fresh lubricant. This operation
should be repeated at approximately 1000 miles, and after that whenever necessary.
The rear axle outer roller bearings are lubricated by means of dope cups.
These cups should be kept filled with a good grade of grease and given a full turn
every 100 miles. Before putting the truck back in service after the rear axle
has been taken down, fill the differential with oil, jack up the axle and run it for
five or ten minutes to insure proper lubrication of all bearings.</p>

removed, be sure to put the transmission cover plates in position. These plates
may be obtained from the nearest dealer.</p>

 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">When assembling the Bendix Drive to the starting motor shaft, care must be
used to see that the stop nut or bearing which enters the mounting bracket on
the starting motor is not too tight; also that the bearing is in proper alignment
with the bracket. The bearing should be oiled and then fitted so that it can be
turned readily with the fingers. If the bearing is too tight, it should be dressed
down with an oil stone. Too tight a fit will cause the bearing to freeze to the
bracket, resulting in serious damage to the starter.</p>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">If it is found necessary to remove the generator, first take out the three cap
screws holding it to the front end cover and by placing the point of a screw-driver
between the generator and front end cover, the generator may be forced off the
engine assembly. Always start at the top of the generator and force it backward
and downward at the same time. Plates may be obtained from the nearest dealer
to place over the time gear if the car is to be operated with the generator removed.</p>

 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">When installing the generator, the drive pinion must be properly meshed with
the large time gear. The generator bracket, that is, the section to which the
generator is bolted is separate from the cylinder block and the meshing of the
generator driving pinion with the large time gear can be regulated by the use of
one or more paper gaskets between the bracket and the cylinder block. The
bracket should rest tightly on the crankcase gasket and line up with the face of
the time gear case. If these gears are meshed too tightly, a humming noise
will result, also the generator shaft will be thrown out of alignment.</p>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">If for any reason the engine is run with the generator disconnected from the battery,
as on a block test, or when battery has been removed for repair or recharging,
be sure that the generator is grounded by running a wire from the terminal on
generator to one of the dust cover screws in the yoke. Two strands of shipping
tag wire may be used for this purpose. Be sure that the connections at both
ends of the wire are tight. Failure to do this when running the engine with the
generator disconnected from the battery will result in serious injury to the generator.

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Hydrometer Readings. (Cut No. 24)</p>
</div></div>

<p class="pn b1">Hydrometer readings should be taken
about every two weeks to make sure
that the generator is keeping the battery
charged. To take a hydrometer reading,
remove the filling plugs (remove the plug
from only one cell at a time). Next,
insert hydrometer syringe in the filler
tube and draw up enough of the solution
to float the glass bulb inside the instrument.
The reading of the scale at the
surface of the liquid (see Cut No. 24)
gives the strength of the solution. Be
sure to return the electrolyte to the cell
from which it was taken. Following is
a list of the readings with their indications.
The readings in parentheses apply
to batteries used in tropical climates
where water never freezes. Readings of
1.275 (1.200) or more indicate a fully
charged battery. Readings of less than
1.225 (1.130) but more than 1.150 (1.080)
indicate complete discharge. Hydrometer
tests taken immediately after filling with
water and before it has become thoroughly
mixed with the electrolyte will not show
the true condition of the battery. If the
hydrometer reading shows the battery less
than one-half charged, it should be taken
to the nearest authorized Battery Service
Station for recharging. Continued operation
in a less than half-charged condition is injurious to the battery somewhat
as running on a soft or deflated tire is injurious to the tire. Before replacing the
battery, the cause of the discharged condition should be removed. It may be
due to leaks or grounds in the car wiring or to the electric system having gotten
out of adjustment so that the battery is not kept supplied with the proper
amount of current from the generator. If the reading in one cell is more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
50 points different from the others, it indicates that the cell is not in good order
and the battery should be taken to a skilled service man for attention.</p>

  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer No. 135</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Add nothing but pure water to the cells and do it often enough to keep the plates
covered at all times. The solution (electrolyte) should be maintained at a
level with the bottom of the filling tube. Distilled water, melted artificial
(but not natural) ice and rain water, if obtained in the open country from a
clean slate or shingle-covered roof, are generally satisfactory. All water for
battery use should be kept in clean, covered vessels of glass, china, earthenware,
rubber or lead. In cold weather add water only immediately before running the
engine so that the charging will mix the water and electrolyte, and avoid freezing.
If, for any reason, it is necessary to add acid, the battery should be taken
to an authorized Service Station.</p>

  <td class="tdlh"><i>What care should be given the Filling Plugs and Connections?</i></td>
  <td class="tdrl"><span class="mid"><i>Answer&nbsp;No.&nbsp;136</i></span></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Keep the filling plugs and connections tight and the top of the battery clean.
Wiping the battery with a rag moistened with ammonia will counteract the effect
of any of the solution which may be on the outside of the battery. A coating
of heavy oil or vaseline will protect the connectors from corrosion. Keep the
battery firmly secured in position. If clamps are loose, the battery will shift
about in the compartment and result in loose connections, broken cells and other
trouble. If repairs are necessary or if the car is to be laid up for the winter,
take the battery to a skilled service man for proper attention and storage. Do
not entrust the battery to inexperienced or unskilled hands.</p>
